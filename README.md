# bruter
a reliable brute force tool with bash

- This script uses the full power of curl and bash to brute force any login page, with exceptions.

- You have to be familiar with the terminal and Bash scripting to tweak the code for your needs.

- I wrote the script as thc-hydra wasn't as good with live targets and kept ignoring the valid credentials.

- Do your research over the response you want to get with BurpSuite.

- Get the desired curl request from BurpSuite (recommended).

- Modify the cmd variable in the script and add the curl switches you need from the comments in the script.
